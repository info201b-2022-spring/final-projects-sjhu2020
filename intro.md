For our final project, we are interested in gathering statistics on video games. For most of the pandemic, video games were a way to escape and socialize with other players and help reduce stress and improve mental health during that time. We hope to create a better understanding of how the pandemic influenced our interactions with video games.

We will analyze video game using datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khaiid/most-selling-pc-games) on video game sales and popularity. We will use [Google Trends](https://github.com/info201b-2022-spring/final-projects-sjhu2020/blob/main/data/multiTimeline.csv) to analyze which video games and genres were the most popular during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our findings will be displayed in charts that reflect the data over the last few years.
