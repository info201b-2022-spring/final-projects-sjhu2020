For our final project, we are interested in gathering statistics on video games. For most of the pandemic, video games were a way to escape and socialize with other players and help reduce stress and improve mental health during that time. We hope to create a better understanding of how the pandemic influenced our interactions with video games.

We will analyze video game using datasets from Kaggle on video game sales and popularity. We will use google trends to analyze which video games and genres were the most popular during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our findings will be displayed in charts that reflect the data over the last few years.
