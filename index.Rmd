title: "Exploratory Analysis"

#We are interested in gathering statistics on video games for our final project.
#For most of the pandemic, video games were a way to escape and socialize with other players.
#They helped reduce stress and improve mental health during this time.
#Some related projects include an article posted by USA Today in 2021 and api based websites.
#Such as light.gg and lol.wiz that gathers statistics directly from games such as League of Legends and Destiny 2. 
#We hope to answer questions about video game usage during the pandemic such as...
#_"How has COVID changed video game sales and popularity?"_
#_"How have video games impacted mental health during COVID?"_
#_"How has COVID affected video game addiction?"_

#We discovered a number of statistics about the 175 observations (games) in our dataset through our calculations. 
#The most popular PC game sold 42 million copies in comparison to 1 million by the least popular PC game.
#This gives us a wide range in popularity of games to work with. 
#The most popular game in our dataset was PlayerUnknownâ€™s Battlegrounds, which was released in December of 2017.
